# **Decentralised AI Project**

## **Overview**
This project is an open-source decentralised AI system designed to:
- Train AI models without centralised data collection using Federated Learning.
- Govern AI model updates using blockchain-based smart contracts.
- Store AI models securely in decentralised storage (IPFS).
- Execute AI models without reliance on centralised cloud providers.

### **Why Decentralised AI?**
Traditional AI systems are centralised, meaning corporations own the models and control access. This project ensures AI remains open, transparent, and resistant to corporate control by using federated learning, blockchain governance, and decentralised execution.

## **Getting Started**
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/decentralised_AI.git
cd decentralised_AI
```

### **2. Install Dependencies**
Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then run:
```
pip install -r federated_ai/requirements.txt
```

---

## **Federated AI Training (Local AI Training)**
Federated learning allows AI models to train locally without exposing raw data to a central server. Model updates are encrypted before sharing.
```
python federated_ai/federated_ai.py
```
Once training is complete, the model is prepared for decentralised storage.

---

## **Store AI Model in Decentralised Storage (IPFS)**
After training, the AI model is stored on IPFS, making it publicly retrievable.
```
python ipfs/store_model.py
```
This generates an IPFS hash, which is required to retrieve and execute the model later.

---

## **Deploy Blockchain Smart Contract for AI Governance**
AI models must be approved by decentralised governance before use. The smart contract stores AI model hashes and enables community voting.

### **Deploy Smart Contract on Goerli Testnet**
```
npx hardhat run blockchain/deploy_script.js --network goerli
```

Once deployed, the smart contract will:
- Store AI models as immutable records.
- Enable decentralised voting on AI model updates.
- Prevent unauthorised modifications.

---

## **Run AI Model on Decentralised Compute**
AI models are executed without centralised servers, either locally or via decentralised compute networks.

```
python inference/decentralized_inference.py
```

---

## **Features and Components**
### **Federated Learning (Decentralised AI Training)**
- AI models train without centralised data collection.
- Updates are encrypted and securely shared across nodes.

### **Blockchain-Based AI Governance**
- Smart contract voting ensures AI models are not controlled by corporations.
- Only approved models are stored and used.

### **IPFS Storage (Decentralised Model Distribution)**
- AI models are stored on IPFS, preventing censorship.
- Anyone can access and verify model integrity.

### **Decentralised AI Execution**
- Models can be executed locally or via decentralised compute networks.

---

## **Roadmap**
Planned Features:
- Integrate AI training across multiple decentralised nodes.
- Improve privacy protection with differential privacy and homomorphic encryption.
- Expand support for more blockchain networks (Ethereum, Arbitrum, etc.).
- Optimise decentralised inference for real-world applications.

## **License**
This project is licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.

- Apache 2.0: Allows commercial use, prevents patenting.

The license ensures that AI remains decentralised and is not controlled by any single entity.
